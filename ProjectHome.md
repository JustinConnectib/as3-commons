The AS3Commons project is dedicated to one principal goal: creating and maintaining reusable ActionScript 3.0 components. This is a place for collaboration and sharing, where developers from throughout the community can work together on projects to be shared.

AS3Commons developers will make an effort to ensure that their components have minimal dependencies on other libraries, so that these components can be deployed easily. In addition, AS3Commons components will keep their interfaces as stable as possible, so that users (including other AS3Commons projects) can implement these components without having to worry about changes in the future.

We welcome participation from all that are interested, at all skill levels. Coding, documentation and testing are all critical parts of the software development process. If you are interested in participating in any of these aspects, please join us!
